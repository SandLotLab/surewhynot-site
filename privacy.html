                This Privacy Policy explains how surewhynot.app (“Site”) handles information when you access or use the Site.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Summary:
                <br>- No account registration required.
                <br>- Tools are designed to run locally in your browser where possible.
                <br>- Limited technical data may be processed for security, performance, analytics, and advertising.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Information We Collect:
                <br>
                We do not require you to submit personal information to use the Site.
                However, certain information may be collected or processed automatically:
                <br>- Technical data (e.g., IP address, user agent, device/browser type, approximate location derived from IP).
                <br>- Usage data (e.g., pages visited, navigation events, timestamps, performance metrics).
                <br>- Advertising data (e.g., cookie identifiers or ad interaction signals handled by ad providers).
                <br>
                We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                User Input to Tools:
                <br>
                Tool input (text you paste, files you upload, or data you generate) is processed to provide the requested output.
                Where the tool is implemented client-side, processing occurs in your browser.
                If any tool uses server-side processing in the future, this policy will be updated to describe what is transmitted and stored.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Local Storage:
                <br>
                Some tools or games may use browser local storage to save preferences or progress.
                This information remains on your device and can be cleared by you at any time through your browser settings.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Cookies and Similar Technologies:
                <br>
                The Site and third parties may use cookies, local storage, pixels, or similar technologies to:
                <br>- Provide basic site functionality and performance.
                <br>- Measure traffic and usage.
                <br>- Serve and measure advertising.
                <br>
                You can control cookies through your browser settings. Blocking cookies may affect advertising behavior and, in some cases, site functionality.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Analytics:
                <br>
                We may use analytics to measure traffic and performance (e.g., page views, referrers, error rates, and performance timing).
                We do not intentionally store personally identifiable information in analytics reports.
                Analytics providers may process technical identifiers (including IP addresses) as part of delivering analytics services.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Advertising:
                <br>
                This site may display advertising, including Google AdSense.
                Advertising providers may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads, limit repetition, measure performance, and personalize ad content where permitted.
                You can manage ad preferences via browser settings and Google ad controls.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Sharing of Information:
                <br>
                We may share information in these cases:
                <br>- Service providers: vendors that help operate the Site (hosting, analytics, advertising).
                <br>- Legal: to comply with law, legal process, or enforce Site terms.
                <br>- Security: to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Data Retention:
                <br>
                Client-side data stored in your browser remains until you clear it.
                Server-side logs and analytics (if any) are retained only as long as necessary for security, performance, and operational purposes.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Security:
                <br>
                Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to help protect the Site.
                No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

                <div class="hr"></div>

                Children:
                <br>
                The Site is not directed to children under 13 and is not intended for their use.
                We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

                Changes take effect when posted on this page with an updated effective date.
